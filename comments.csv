1,Kellie Tipton,"After 4.5 years, I have finally graduated with my bachelors degree. I just finished finals a week ago and I wanted to come back by and thank you for making this video. I watched this video countless times and studied ""with"" you when I didn't think I could possibly get it all done by the deadline. Endless cramming and work on assignments can be lonely stuff, so it was nice to have it feel like someone was there working hard alongside me. Thank you for studying with me all those times ❤",20K,2 years ago,102

5,Steve,wtf is lofi?,0,6 months ago,0
5,CarateCarter,"@Steve Lo-fi is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections of a recording or performance are audible, sometimes as a deliberate aesthetic choice. Lo-fi aesthetics are based on weird characteristics that arise during the recording process. More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of audio engineering as undesirable effects, such as a degraded audio signal or fluctuations in tape speed. The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances. Recordings deemed unprofessional or ""amateurish"" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, distortion, or room acoustics). Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as ""phonographic"" and ""non-phonographic imperfections"". He defines the former as ""elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.""",8,6 months ago,0

8,Felicmarisonn,"@Sara Just came across your comment.. So how is it now? I`m a procrastinater myself but I started to realize it was toxic for my health and the balance between work/studying/whatever and the enjoyable things in life. Its a long way up :) !    One can only practice focussing and I am far from being as productive as many of those YouTubers nowadays. But its a tremendous success to even just get a few things done in time, whatsoever. Anyways, I wish you the best and everyone who comes across this comment section. I`m glad the ""study with me"" videos are more of a helpful kind and not like ""I`m showing my oh-so productive lifestyle, I`m focused all the time, my daily life is coloured in pastells"".                                                  No offense- I do watch vlogs like these from time to time, but its not reall helpful for someone to get told you can increase your productivity within a 15 minutes video of someones perfect study routine..    Soo.. I am a huge fan of TheStrive Studies videos, they actually have a lot of impact on my studying. Its a simple help with getting productive while studying.

84,Cynthia Le,"Asian aren’t born to be smarter, but we work much harder. Ever since I came to the U.S., no one believes that I used to study such a long time everyday in China. I studied about 2 hours in kindergarten after class (at that time I was forced to cuz I didn’t know how to enjoy study yet, and I was about 4-6.) I studied over 4 hours after class in elementary school after class. In middle school, I overall studied 12 hours including going to class everyday. After I went to high school, I studied about 14 hours everyday, and some of my classmates spent literally all of their time (maybe more than 16 hours) to study and even reduced their time to sleep. This is true. Grades won’t come because you want good score. It comes when you actually work for good score.",2.8K,1 year ago,84

Im really happy that you made a decision to seek a 'balance' in life, and do abit more socializing. I am too of the view that life is more than just studying/working. However so much more factors come to play. Would it be fair for a person born in privilege (not by his/her own merit) to tell a person who was born in poverty to stop working and enjoy life? Does the latter have a choice? What right does the former have to tell the latter? This is but just one of many factors, but what is clear is that more than race comes to play.",17,1 year ago,0

Couple that with passion and enthusiasm for what you are learning and a sense that all of your efforts are leading you towards a meaningful outcome (including personal growth)... students who take this type of approach are likely to find themselves heading down a path towards all kinds of cool opportunities.

257,Sungjae Pae,"Hello I am from south korea. Do you know why Asian people look smart? Honestly, we are not smart, but we study longer. For my country, it is common to study for at least 12 hours everyday since middle school. Most Asian people get used to study over 10 hours everyday. Also, the United States education system is much easier than our country. Our country' exam is much harder than any exam in the U.S. That is why we look smart. I think if you study at least over 12 hours per day, you can accomplish it no mater what kind of field you are in.",376,3 years ago,33

Ah, and fyi, I study at an Indian-based study system. Out of all the schooling systems I've switched thus far, however, I find Taiwan's one of the most rigourous for elementary schooling - While Indians go for the QnA type of education, the syllabus over there used to go for short, yet efficient and a highly skilled study environment there... However, I'm not used to many systems (I've only changed about 7 schools and got homeschooled and stuff by the time I neared the end of highschool, lol), so this is based on my personal experience 😂",16,2 years ago,0

I don't think any university in Korea would make students read and write that much. That part got me quite sad.

257,evgenia,"USA system is not designed for students to study in school. Neither is the Swedish one. I am an university student now, and the time spend in school is more of a social play time/listening to egonarcissistic teacher delivering a teatrical performance. *(Imagine not being able to take notes in any of your classes, because there is no time to do that.) The idea behind this is that students would be able to ask questions and discover knowlage through social conversation, but reality of it is that it is hard to ask questions in front of the whole class, most people do not do it at all. And even with questions, teachers often cannot answer them, because they must follow a study program and deliver a certain amount of concrete information, but they themselves either never knew much more then what they are delivering or cannot connect that information to the real life experiences... Like in medical field. To become a doctor, you might have to study with scientists, a class has 4-6 different teachers, who are very well knowlaged about structure of lets say, ears, eyes and human feet, but they never touched a patient and they never really used their knowlage for anything else then to write a paper on the subject.",1,1 year ago (edited),0

I won't say you would be topping your class with this meagre input, but you'll do decently well and learn what 'you' really want to, and as an added benefit you'll enjoy your life to your fullest while spending majority of your time with your family and friends.

But, recently, I realized what was my real dream and I've been struggling with it even though I don't have confidence. I'm really thankful myself that I tried find something for studying and I found you and I could study with you. My dream is going to be a Veterinarian  who gives love and happiness to animals. I gave up going to university in AU that I want because I don't have the enough money but Ima definitely challenge it again. I'll fail over and over and finally I'll get it. Thanks for your video and motivation. I'm not good at using English but I tried, and I'll try everything I want like this because I don't want to regret.

Then if not done, do you do a rotation and start again? For example: I have math, Eng. Lit, and intro to teaching class...so for each of those I do a cycle of 25 min of study time and if I didn't finish math and Eng. Lit., would I start over again with times and tasks?
